# AWS Cloud Administrator Study Lab (Simulated)

This project simulates hands-on AWS Cloud Administrator labs using WSL, Linux, and local scripting — to mirror a real AWS environment without needing access to the cloud (yet).

## 📅 Weekly Breakdown

- **Week 1: IAM & Cloud Fundamentals**  
  Focus on IAM concepts, policy simulation, user/role creation using Bash & Linux

- **Week 2: EC2 & Storage**
  Will simulate EC2 provisioning, SSH key pairs, and S3 structure locally

## 📁 Repo Structure

Each week is organized into its own folder with scripts, JSON files, and documentation.
